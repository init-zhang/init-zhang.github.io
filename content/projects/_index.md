## [Template.css](init-zhang.github.io/template.css/)

A super minimal, classless CSS template that looks great on its own and can serve as a base for your own CSS design.

This website uses Template.css as a base. Template.css is standard Markdown ready and supports all its syntax, which made it perfect for this site.

Starting from a blank CSS file for a small project can be intimidating. Template.css aims to solve this, either use the CSS as is or use as base for your own changes and design.

## [Jarmos](https://github.com/init-zhang/jarmos)

A CLI graphing calculator I made whilst learning Java. The project name is a portmanteau of Jar files and Desmos.

It currently supports basic operations and a full parser. The graph accuracy can be specified, which attempts to fill in missing gaps by calculating intermediate coordinates.

## [Zhang's Web Journal](https://github.com/init-zhang/zhangs-web-journal)

Personal markdown journal and note taking app accessible on localhost. Year, month, and day overviews with titles and descriptions.

The project is reaching it's end of development as I have a new journal system in place. The last update will be full tag implementation, which was the last feature I was working on.

## [CSV To HTML Table Converter](https://github.com/init-zhang/csv-html-table)

Converts CSV into HTML. Allows me to use CSV for tables instead of the standard table markdown, which saves me typing time.

Automatically implemented into Zhang's Web Journal. It was made because I wanted to spend less time making tables whilst journaling.
