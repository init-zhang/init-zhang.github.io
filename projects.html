        <summary><h3>Zhang's Web Journal</h3></summary>
        <p>Real creative name, I know. This is my own journal and note taking application that runs on Flask and can be accessed using localhost.</p>
        <p>It uses Markdown files internally, so everything is human readable with any editor and can be easily exported to HTML.</p>

        <p>So far it has been basic features, such as:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Basic markdown support</li>
            <li>Table of contents</li>
            <li>Year and month views</li>
            <li>Title and description metadata</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I've been using this app for a few months now and have been adding features as I deemed fit. You're free to fork this project and tailor it to your own needs.</p>

        <p>You can find the <a href="https://github.com/init-zhang/zhangs-web-journal">source code here</a>. It also contains TODO for the project.</p>

        <summary><h3>Jarmos</h3></summary>

        <p>A CLI graphing calculator I made whilst learning Java. It's primitive at best, with basic operations and no functions. It was more of a tool to learn parsing and Java.</p>

        <p>It supports different levels of accuracy and graph sizes. It has a few caveats and compromises, as well as no validation. You can read more on the GitHub below.</p>
