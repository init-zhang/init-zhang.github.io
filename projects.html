        <summary><h3>Zhang's Web Journal</h3></summary>
        <p>Real creative name, I know. This Flask application is a <strong>localhost</strong>, personal journal and blog which uses Markdown files internally. This way, you can view your data even without the app.</p>
        <p>So far it has been basic features, such as:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Basic markdown support</li>
            <li>Table of contents</li>
            <li>Year and month views</li>
            <li>Entry title and descripton metadata</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I've been using this app for a few months now and have been adding features as I deemed fit. You're free to fork this project and tailor it to your own needs.</p>

        <p>I don't have a live demo as the app is <strong>strictly localhost</strong> (it uses Flask's development server). You can find the <a href="https://github.com/init-zhang/zhangs-web-journal">source code here</a>.</p>

        <summary><h3>Bash HTTP Server</h3></summary>
        <p>Does exactly what it says on the tin. It's a HTTP server made in Bash using Netcat.</p>

        <p><strong>This should not be used in production.</strong> You would be insane to use this single-threaded HTTP (notice there's no S) server and expose it to the web.

        <summary><h3>Jarmos</h3></summary>

        <p>A CLI graphing calculator I made whilst learning Java. It's primitive at best, only with basic operations and no functions. It was more of a tool to learn parsing and Java.</p>

        <p>It supports different levels of accuracy.</p>
